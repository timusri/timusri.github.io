## Talk Overview

In this talk at DevOps Days Bangalore 2023, I shared insights on using Kubecost to optimize cloud costs for Kubernetes workloads, specifically focusing on EKS clusters and GPU-intensive workloads at Invideo.

### Key Topics Covered

- **Kubecost Implementation**: Setting up and configuring Kubecost for EKS clusters
- **Cost Visibility**: Gaining granular insights into resource consumption and costs
- **GPU Workload Optimization**: Strategies for efficient GPU utilization and cost management
- **Auto-scaling Strategies**: Right-sizing resources based on actual usage patterns
- **FinOps Best Practices**: Implementing cost optimization workflows in DevOps teams
- **Real-world Results**: Cost savings and efficiency gains achieved at Invideo

### Key Takeaways

- How to identify and eliminate wasteful spending in Kubernetes clusters
- Best practices for GPU workload cost optimization
- Actionable strategies to reduce EKS operational costs
- Building a cost-conscious culture in engineering teams

### Target Audience

This talk is designed for:
- DevOps Engineers managing Kubernetes infrastructure
- Platform Engineers working with EKS
- FinOps practitioners looking to optimize cloud costs
- Engineering leaders responsible for infrastructure budgets
- Anyone working with GPU-intensive workloads on Kubernetes

### About the Event
